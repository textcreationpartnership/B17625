            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <l>The pious Mobily for they know not what:</l>
               <l>So tho by different ways the Feaver seize,</l>

               <l>'Cause the first Project took, is now so vain,</l>
               <l>To attempt to Play the old Game o're again:</l>
               <l>The Scene is only chang'd, for who wou'd lay</l>
               <l>A Plot, so hopeful, just the same dull way.</l>
               <l>Poets, like States-men, with a little change,</l>
               <l>Pass off old Politicks for new and strange;</l>
               <l>Tho the few men of sense decry't aloud,</l>
               <l>The cheat will pass with the unthinking Crowd:</l>
               <l>The Rabble 'tis we Court, those powerful things,</l>

               <l>A Pox of Sense and Reason, or dull Rules,</l>
               <l>Give us an Audience that declares for fools;</l>
               <l>Our Play will then stand fair, we've Monsters too,</l>

               <l>Did the most Politick diversion hold.</l>
               <l>Plays were so useful thought to Government,</l>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Dread to appear in this Humble Dedication to Your Royal Highness, as one of those Insolent and Saucy Offenders who take occasion by Your absence to commit ill-manner'd indecencies, unpardonable to a Prince of your Illustrious Birth and God-like Goodness, but that in spight of Seditious Scandal You can forgive; and all the World knows You can suffer with a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Patience: the proofs You have early and late given of this, have been such, as if Heaven design'd 'em only to give the World an undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Testimony of Your Noble Vertues, Your Loyalty and True Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (if I may presume to say so,) both to Your Sacred Brother, and the never satisfied People, when either one Commanded, or t'other repin'd, With how chearful and intire a submission You Obey'd? And tho the Royal Son of a Glorious Father who was render'd unfortunate by the unexemplary ingratitude of his worst of Subjects; and sacrific'd to the insatiate and cruel Villany of a seeming sanctifi'd Faction, who cou'd never hope to expiate for the unparallell'd sin, but by an intire submission to the Gracious Off-spring of this Royal Martyr: yet You, Great Sir, denying Your self the Rights and Priviledges the meanest Subject Claims, with a Fortitude worthy Your Adorable Vertues, put Your self upon a voluntary Exile to appease the causeless murmurs of this again gathering Faction, who make their needless and self-created fears, an occasion to Play the old Game o're again; whil'st the Politick self-interested and malitious few betray the unconsidering
<pb facs="tcp:173126:5"/> Rest, with the delicious sounds of Liberty and Publick Good; that lucky Cant which so few years since so miserably reduc'd all the Noble, Brave and Honest, to the Obedience of the ill-gotten Power, and worse-acted Greatness of the Rabble; so that whil'st they most unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cry'd down the oppression of one of the best of Monarchs, and all Kingly Government: all <hi>England</hi> found it self deplorably inslav'd by the Arbitrary Tyranny of many Pageant Kings. Oh that we shou'd so far forget with what greatness of mind You then shar'd the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fate, as now again to force Your Royal Person to new Perils, and new Exiles; but such ingratitude we are punisht with, and You still suffer for, and still forgive it.</p>
            <p>This more than Human Goodness, with the incouragement Your Royal Highness was pleas'd to give the Rover at his first appearance, and the concern You were pleas'd to have for his second, makes me presume to lay him at Your feet; he is a wanderer too, distrest; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd, tho unfortunate, and ever constant to Loyalty; were he Legions he should follow and suffer still with so Excellent a Prince and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. Your Infant worth he knew, and all Your growing Glories; has seen you like young <hi>Cesar</hi> in the Field, when yet a Youth, exchanging Death for Laurels, and wondred at a Bravery so early, which still made double Conquest, not only by Your Sword, but by Your Vertues, which taught even Your Enemies so intire an Obedience, that asham'd of their Rebel Gallantry, they have resign'd their guilty Commissions,<note place="margin">Some of <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>'s Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at <hi>Dunkirk.</hi>
               </note> and Vow'd never to Draw Sword more but in the Royal Cause; which Vow Religiously they kept: a noble Example for the busie and hot Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineers of this Age misled by Youth, false Ambition, and falser Council.</p>
            <p>How careless since Your Glorious Restauration You have been, of Your Life for the service of Your mistaken Country, the whole World knows, and all brave men admire.</p>
            <p>Pardon me then, Great Sir, if I presume to present my faithful Soldier, (which no Storms of Fate can ever draw from his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) to so great a General: allow him, Royal Sir, a shelter and protection, who was driven from his Native Country with You, forc'd as You were, to fight for his Bread in a strange Land, and suffer'd with You all the Ills of Poverty, War and Banishment, and still pursues Your Fortunes; and though he cannot serve Your Highness, he may possibly have the Honour of diverting You a few moments: which tho Your Highness cannot want in a place where all Hearts and Knees are
<pb facs="tcp:173126:6"/> justly bow'd in Adoration, where all conspire, as all the Earth (who have the blessing of Your presence) ought to entertain, serve and please You; yet this humble Tribute of a most Zealous and Devout Heart, may find amongst Your busier hours of greater moment, some one wherein it may have the Glory of Your regard, and be capable in some small degree of unbending Your great mind from Royal Cares, the weightiest Cares of all; which if it be so fortunate as to do, I have my end, and the Glory I design, a sufficient reward for her who does and will eternally pray for the Life, Health and Safety of Your Royal Highness, as in Duty all the World is bound to do, but more especially,</p>
